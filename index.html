						<h2>What's new?</h2>
                            <h3>Spring Update / Summer Kickoff</h3>
                                <ul>Coming soon...</ul>
							<h3>Winter Update</h3>
								<p>Hello everyone! Time for a winter update.</p>

								<p>First, we now have 20 members signed up on the forums. Welcome to all of our new members and those just checking things out.
								We would like to start growing our numbers a bit over the next year, with a goal in mind of about 50 active members.</p>

								<p>Our current servers include a Tekkit server and a possible Starbound server that is in testing.
								Funding for our infrastructure and servers is being covered by myself and Zoobaka, but donations are always welcome.<br/>
								More funding equals more private servers!</p>

								<p>A shout out to Zoobaka, Hotaru, and Caladan for consistently getting in Star Citizen chat and representing. Keep up the good work!</p>

								<p>Also a reminder to new members to post an introduction! Accounts with 0 posts can not send private messages and have a few other spam prevention measures, so get posting!</p>

								<p>Finally, we are working on a new front page for exohelix.com. Most of this work is being done by our own Dingocat.
								We should have a preview available soon, with a goal to have the new site online after the new year.
								The current forums will stay, but some theme changes may be made to better tie the forums to our branding on exohelix.com.</p>

								<p>Things are looking up for the ExoHelix crew, 2014 will be a great year for us.</p>

								<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
							<h3>Tweet Tweet!</h3>
								<p>Although apparently Cereph made a twitter account for ExoHelix (and we didn't realize...), there is a new twitter to check out the newest happenings!</p>
								<p>Check it out over there. ----> </p>
							<h3> The Forums Are Online</h3>
								<p>The forums to go with the new site are online! After a bit of work and a false start, we have a really nice forum system setup. So get in there and get posting!</p>
								<p>Bonus news update: The new mumble server is online as well! Now with forum account integration. Check out the news section on the forums to learn more.</p>
